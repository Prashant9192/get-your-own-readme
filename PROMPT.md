### Start of Prompt ###

Act as a Senior Full Stack Developer and Technical Writer. Your goal is to generate a professional, high-performance GitHub Profile README.md based on the following details:

- **Name:** [Your Full Name]
- **Current Role:** [e.g., Full Stack Developer at X Agency]
- **Core Tech Stack:** [e.g., React, Next.js, Node.js, Laravel]
- **Specialties:** [e.g., SaaS Builder, SEO, Performance Optimization]
- **Key Projects:** [Project 1: Link/Desc], [Project 2: Link/Desc]
- **Contact:** [Email, LinkedIn, Portfolio Link]

### Formatting Rules:
1. **Clean Header:** Use centered text with professional badges for social links.
2. **Professional Snapshot:** Write a 3-sentence high-impact bio focusing on value and results.
3. **Optimized Tech Table:** Create a scannable table with categories: Frontend, Backend, Database, and Tools.
4. **Reliable Stats (A+ to S-Rank Logic):** - Use the stable mirror: `https://github-readme-stats-eight-theta.vercel.app/` to avoid "Error Fetching Resource".
   - Include these parameters to show true impact: `&show_icons=true`, `&theme=vision-friendly-dark`, `&hide_border=true`, `&count_private=true`, and `&include_all_commits=true`.
5. **Modern Activity Graph:** Use `https://github-readme-activity-graph.vercel.app/graph` with `&theme=react-dark&area=true`.
6. **Visitor Badge:** Add a visitor count badge at the very bottom using `visitor-badge.laobi.icu`.

### Output Style:
The tone should be professional, clean, and developer-centric. Use Markdown horizontal rules to separate sections clearly.
